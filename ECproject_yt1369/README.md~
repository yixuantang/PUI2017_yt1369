## HW2
## Assignment 1: Show Bus Location
First, I apply API key through MTA website;
then I write script to read the json file and get a csv output about the bus line, active bus amounts and bus location. 
(I indeed submit this homework on time, however I incautiously delete this file when I upload the HW3, so I revert the file in Oct 4th)

## Assignment 2: Get Bus Info
First,  I use the API key to access to the data,
then I design the script to pull the current json file and get the information about the next bus stop of specific bus line.
The script takes 3 arguments: API key, bus line and output file name. 

## Assignment 3: Read CSV Files with Pandas
This is my [notebook](https://localhost:8000/user/yt1369/notebooks/homedirs/yt1369/Assignment3_Read_CSVfiles_yt1369.ipynb).
I used pandas to accomplish the work.

## Extra work with pandas
In this assignment, I need to use pandas to deal with date/time, I try to plot the number of motorists injured by dates.
