Hi Ian,

Your plot is super cool and I learnt a lot from it! Here's some viewpoints and suggestions.

* CLARITY: 
The legend in your plot clearly guide me what I can read from this map, once I open the carto map and move cursor on each dot, it will automatically presents the location, age, EUI, type and total units of each building.

* ESTHETIC: 
The color map you used is suitable and readable, after zoom out on Carto, I can easily read that Manhattan midtown and uptown have most oldest multifamily buildings. But if you want to present "1) Where are the older buildings in NYC?", you should also plot other building types, otherwise this map would be misleading.

* HONESTY: 
In your notebook, you used LL84 and Pluto data from 2012 to 2016, and this plot honestly reproduced the data you processed.
Lastly, one suggestions is, since you only select the multifamily type building in your dataset, you should clarify that this is a multifamily building map, and remove the guide question "3) What types of buildings are they" in your legend.

In conclusion, your visualization is readable and meaningful, hope the suggestions above are useful in improving your plot.

Your classmate,

# FBB things you missed:

**estheetics** the legend in white on the black map is very distracting to the eye and leads the viewer to focus on reading instead of looking at the plot. Similarly the legend is visually distracting

the low contrast of the black map makes it hard to separate NYC from the surruundings

no boundaries around the boroughs and the choice of plotting points at the center of the zipcode are incompatible as we do not know what the edge points reach is

**clarity / honesty** the default zoom level shows a map that cuts off datapoints at the bottom


**clarity** not all features indicated in the legend are plotted
