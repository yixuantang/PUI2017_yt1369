**CLARITY**  
Although it is clear the graph is showing that different parts of NY have different energy intensities, it is not clear what the units mean or how much more energy each category represents compared to the others. It would have been nice for some type of normalization in the scale.
The caption mentions the percentage each category is covering. It describes for example, that category yellow *“is over the 75% of the city”*. It sounds a little confusing, like if 75% of NYC area has the yellow category. 
From looking at the graph I understand it means that each category represents a quarter of the city **zipcodes**, not area. In any case, it feels like the information from the graph and the caption is conflicting. 
 
**AESTHETHIC**  
The colors are chosen appropiately, with a colorblind tool they still look readable, although in this case, the caption would be more difficult to understand (it mentions colors by their name). Anyway, I think is a pleasing choise of colors.

**HONESTY**  
The Energy Use intensity seems to be strongly correlating to population density. The graph is implicating some areas consume more energy, but I don't know if it's because there is more poeple of because there is more inefficient buildings, etc. Some type of normalization accounting for population density would have been useful to control for this. 
Also, when the graph mentions percentages of the city, it sounds like area but in reality is zipcodes (I think, but it's not clear).
